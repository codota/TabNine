# Changelog

### 8.1.0

* Added Closure compiler type definitions

### 8.0.0

* Polyfill default promise with `finally` if it doesn't exist if you use polyfill.js
* If using `require` with webpack 2+, you now need to do

```js
var Promise = require('promise-polyfill').default;
```

instead of

```js
var Promise = require('promise-polyfill');
```

* Removed files /dist/promise.js and /dist/promise.min.js. These files were not used unless you downloaded them directly from the repo. They were not used by ES6 modules, CommonJS or polyfill.js
  The file lead to issues because they overrode the global Promise by default.

### 7.1.2

* Fixed bug in Node JS Promise polyfill

### 7.1.0

* Added Promise.prototype.finally

### 7.0.2

* Added IE8 compatability back to minify

### 7.0.1

* Fixed a bug in 'catch' keyword in IE8
* Fixed import error when using `require`

## 7.0.0

* Updated code to ES6 module definitions (thanks Andarist)
* Added polyfill.js file
* move compiled files to dist folder

## 6.1.0

* Bug fix for non-array values in `Promise.all()`
* Small optimization checking for making sure `Promise` is called with `new`

## 6.0.0 Deprecated `Promise._setImmediateFn` and `Promise._setUnhandledRejectionFn`

This allows subclassing Promise without rewriting functions

* `Promise._setImmediateFn(<immediateFn>)` has been deprecated. Use `Promise._immediateFn = <immediateFn>` instead.
* `Promise._setUnhandledRejectionFn(<rejectionFn>)` has been deprecated. Use `Promise._unhandledRejectionFn = <rejectionFn>` instead.
  These functions will be removed in the next major version.

### 5.2.1 setTimeout to 0

Fixed bug where setTimeout was set to 1 instead of 0 for async execution

### 5.2.0 Subclassing

Allowed Subclassing. [#27](https://github.com/taylorhakes/promise-polyfill/pull/27)

### 5.1.0 Fixed reliance on setTimeout

Changed possibly unhanded warnings to use asap function instead of setTimeout

## 5.0.0 Removed multiple params from Promise.all

Removed non standard functionality of passing multiple params to Promise.all. You must pass an array now. You must change this code

```js
Promise.all(prom1, prom2, prom3);
```

to this

```js
Promise.all([prom1, prom2, prom3]);
```

### 4.0.4 IE8 console.warn fix

IE8 does not have console, unless you open the developer tools. This fix checks to makes sure console.warn is defined before calling it.

### 4.0.3 Fix case in bower.json

bower.json had Promise.js instead of promise.js

### 4.0.2 promise.js case fix in package.json

Fixed promise.js in package.json. It was accidently published as Promise.js

## 4.0.1 Unhandled Rejections and Other Fixes

* Added unhandled rejection warnings to the console
* Removed Grunt, jasmine and other unused code
* Renamed Promise.js to lowercase promise.js in multiple places

### 3.0.1 Fixed shadowing issue on setTimeout

New version fixing this major bug https://github.com/taylorhakes/promise-polyfill/pull/17

## 3.0.0 Updated setTimeout to not be affected by test mocks

This is considered a breaking change because people may have been using this functionality. If you would like to keep version 2 functionality, set Promise.\_setImmediateFn on `promise-polyfill` like the code below.

```js
var Promise = require('promise-polyfill');
Promise._setImmedateFn(function(fn) {
  setTimeout(fn, 1);
});
```

### 2.1.0 Promise.\_setImmedateFn

Removed dead code Promise.immedateFn and added Promise.\_setImmediateFn(fn);

### 2.0.2 Simplified Global detection

Simplified attaching to global object

### 2.0.1 Webworker bugfixes

Fixed Webworkers missing window object

## 2.0.0

**Changed the following line**

```
module.exports = root.Promise ? root.Promise : Promise;
```

to

```
module.exports = Promise;
```

This means the library will not use built-in Promise by default. This allows for more consistency.

You can easily add the functionality back.

```
var Promise = window.Promise || require('promise-polyfill');
```

**Added Promise.immediateFn to allow changing the setImmedate function**

```
Promise.immediateFn = window.setAsap;
```

### 1.1.4 Updated Promise to use correct global object in Browser and Node

### 1.1.3 Fixed browserify issue with `this`

### 1.1.2 Updated Promise.resolve to resolve with original Promise

### 1.1.0 Performance Improvements for Modern Browsers

## 1.0.1 Update README.md
